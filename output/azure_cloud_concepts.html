<h3>Benefits of Cloud Services</h3>
<h4>High availability</h4>
<ul>
<li>Available for long periods of time</li>
<li>availability is NOT backup or disaster recovery</li>
<li>availability is NOT high performance</li>
<li>availability is NOT load balancing</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scalability vs. Elasticity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scalability: increase/decrease workload on current resources</li>
<li>Elasticity: increase/decrease the number of resources e.g. adding/removing VMs</li>
</ul>
<h4>Agility</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quickly respond to changes</li>
<li>Provision or decommission cloud services in minutes using self-service</li>
</ul>
<h4>Disaster recovery</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to recover from a failure e.g. backups for VMs or SQL databases</li>
</ul>
<h4>Capital Expenses (CapEx) vs. Operational Expenses (OpEx)</h4>
<ul>
<li>CapEx are predictable upfront costs </li>
<li>OpEx are ongoing billing costs (pay as you go) and can be deducted from your taxes immediately.</li>
<li>OpEx suited to agile environments where demand is unpredictable</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consumption-based model</h4>
<ul>
<li>Paying for something based on how much you used, as opposed to paying for something no matter if you use it or not. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Categories of Cloud Services</h3>
<h4>IaaS</h4>
<ul>
<li>get a VM and do what you want with it </li>
<li>emulation of a real piece of HW that you can buy in a store </li>
<li>includes virtualised representation of networking, load balancers, firewall</li>
<li>1-to-1 mapping/moving of what you have on-premises, e.g. pieces of hardware, to the cloud</li>
<li>does NOT include SW services e.g. DB's</li>
<li>you control the HW, choice of datacentre, availability zone, nbr of CPU’s</li>
<li>VM’s, Azure Storage, Load balancer, VPNs, network gateways, subnets ; tie things together , move things around</li>
<li>You are responsible for upgrades, patches, version numbers    </li>
</ul>
<h4>PaaS</h4>
<ul>
<li>in Azure they are called <em>Web Apps</em> or <em>App Services</em> </li>
<li>It’s a platform that you need to build upon to be useful</li>
<li>development effort is required to turn it into sth useful</li>
<li>You pay by the hour even if no one visits your App or website</li>
<li>Cloud provider is more involved in this paradigm</li>
<li>You compile code/program, upload it and cloud provider runs that code</li>
<li>not picking out specific pieces of HW, not setting up networks; no choices over the HW</li>
<li>You do have to choose tiers, and plan levels within the tiers (see e.g. App Service plan) but not RAM, CPU’s or manage disk space</li>
<li>You pay for performance (the tiers)<ul>
<li>you have some idea of how many instances are running your code, and what your performance expectations are </li>
<li>scaling is your responsibility: you must decide whether to increase nbr of CPU’s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it is programmable so that you can upload your own code (App Service) </li>
<li>or it has to be programmable so that it can integrate with other things (Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Machine Learning Studio)</li>
<li>It is more useful than raw networking or raw computing</li>
</ul>
<h4>SaaS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dropbox, backup services, google drive, google docs, office365, outlook, Active Directory, CRM tool, any enterprise App, </li>
<li>Anything where you use a web browser to access a service</li>
<li>Access to configuration of existing product only; no access to code</li>
<li>Don’t control servers; only control data and settings</li>
<li>The product is useful stand alone </li>
</ul>
<h4>Serverless</h4>
<ul>
<li>Name is misleading; There are still servers, you just don’t have to ever deal with them</li>
<li>no access to server ; don’t know how many servers or processors are running your code</li>
<li>no control over performance expectations (as opposed to performance via tiers and plans in PaaS)</li>
<li>Cloud provider is responsible for scaling e.g. adding servers or CPU’s as they are needed</li>
<li>Don’t have to worry about choosing the right plan or scaling (up or down)</li>
<li><strong>Means you might pay nothing if you don’t use the service i.e. no one ever visits your App.</strong></li>
<li>You only pay for execution and not for reservation</li>
<li>You pay for CPU and data utilisation, NOT visits</li>
<li>available serverless offers:<ul>
<li>Compute – Azure functions</li>
<li>Compute – serverless kubernetes (virtual nodes w/ACI</li>
<li>Database – Azure SQL Database serverless</li>
<li>Database – Cosmos DB serverless</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Shared Responsibility model</h4>

<h3>Types of Cloud Computing</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Public</p>
<ul>
<li>anyone can sign up for it</li>
<li>azure owns the HW on their network and infrastructure ; you are leasing services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private: </p>
<ul>
<li>you use your own datacentre, HW, upfront capital expenditure (CapEx)</li>
<li>you can license software from the Azure Stack, install on your own hardware</li>
<li>you can use a portal, create VMS etc just like you do with the public cloud</li>
<li>You own the HW etc but you use the services of the public cloud thus getting benefits of flexibility, agility and elasticity </li>
<li>You don’t get the cost savings by just stopping to run sth   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hybrid: </p>
<ul>
<li>extending your disk space or your on-premises databases into the public cloud</li>
<li>i.e. scaling private infrastructure to the cloud</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
