<h4>Knowledge Graphs</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"Knowledge Discovery is the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information
from data."</em> (Frawley et al., 1992)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>"A Knowledge Graph is a directed graph $G = (V, E, R, g)$, where V , E, and R denote
the node, edge, and relation sets, respectively, and $g : E \rightarrow  R$
is a function labeling each edge with a semantic relation or predicate. "</em> (Shiralkar et al., 2017)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>How one node may be reached from another one</h4>
<ul>
<li>A <em>walk</em> is an unrestricted sequence of nodes in which a node or an edge may appear more than once. Its length is simply the number of edges in the walk.</li>
<li>A <em>trail</em> is a walk in which no edge is repeated but nodes may be visited more than once.</li>
<li>A <em>path</em> is a trail in which no edge or node is repeated.</li>
<li>A <em>cycle</em> is a trail with at least 3 nodes in which start and end node are the same.</li>
<li>A <em>geodesic</em> between two nodes is a shortest path between them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Connected vs. Strongly Conncected</h4>
<ul>
<li>An undirected graph is <em>connected</em> if, for every pair of nodes <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>, there is a path from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>.</li>
<li>A directed graph is <em>strongly connected</em> if, for every two nodes <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>, there is a path from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em> and a path from <em>v</em> to <em>u</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Trees</h4>
<ul>
<li>An undirected graph is a tree if it is connected and does not contain a cycle.</li>
<li>A spanning tree of G is a tree that contains all the vertices of G.</li>
<li>Adding a new edge to a spanning tree always creates a cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Explaining RelatednessThe task of explaining the relationship between two or more query nodes involves measuring the relevance of paths in</h4>
<p>the graph that connect those query nodes. The connecting paths represent the implicit relations between the query nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By extension, measuring the relevance of connecting paths involves measuring the relevance of the nodes that are on
  those connecting paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A relevant node is a central node for the (indirect) relation between the query nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"So, while the nodes that are on relevant connecting paths are explicit and simple — just a set of nodes — they represent
implicit information." (Langohr et al., 2012)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>The relative importance of nodes</h4>
<p>Rusinowska et al. (2011) describe the process of finding the top-k relatively important nodes w.r.t. some query nodes, two steps are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Measure the strength of relations</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Centrality measures: degree, closeness and betweeness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prestige methods: degree prestige (think PageRank where a node’s importance is determined by the importance of its
   neighbors) and proximity prestige</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node Ranking</p>
<ul>
<li>RW-based methods</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the characteristics relevant to measuring centrality?</h4>
<p><em>Network flow processes and the dimensions along which they differ</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>flow pocesses vary along mechansism dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy mechansims: serial and parallel diffusion via replication</li>
<li>move mechansim: objects are indivisible and can only be in one place at a time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>flow pocesses vary along trajectory dimensions: shortest paths, paths, trails or walks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors use those two dimensions to construct a topology of flow processes as shown in Table 1 of Borgatti, 2005.</p>
<p><em>Indivisibility</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Objects can only be in one place at a time</p>
<ul>
<li>nodes and edges are used more than once: networked economy &gt; walk-based transfer e.g. money (see also Markov process)</li>
<li>nodes may be visited more than once but edges are not re-used: distribution networks &gt; used goods trails</li>
<li>nodes and edges are not re-used: delivery networks &gt; package arrives through shortest paths</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objects can be in several places at once</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>replication flows in which objects are spread one at a time (serial duplication)</p>
<ul>
<li>does not pass same edge twice but can pass the same node more than once: informal network of persons &gt; gossip trails</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>replication flows in which objects are diffused simultaneously (parallel duplication):</p>
<ul>
<li>radio broadcast</li>
<li>email communication: nodes and edges visited only once  &gt; path</li>
<li>speaker influences audience through interaction: nodes and edges visited only once  &gt; path</li>
<li>infection / disease: nodes and edges visited only once  &gt; path</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Commonly encountered flow processes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>diffusion flows where it matters to be first to get it:</p>
<ul>
<li>general information e.g. R&amp;D technology</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>diffusion flows where it matters to know the target and to take the shortest path:</p>
<ul>
<li>package delivery, traffic, telecomms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>flows where reception speed (i.e. shortest path) does not matter i.e. flow has no target and and does not prefer to
  take shortest path</p>
<ul>
<li>gossip</li>
<li>infections and diseases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>flows in which traffic is able to move via unrestricted walks rather than being constrained by trails, paths or geodesics:</p>
<ul>
<li>no assumption of transfer or replication one at a time</li>
<li>rather it assumes that each node affects all of its neighbours simultaneously (parallel duplication)</li>
<li>
<p>ideally suited for influence type processes: attitudes, beliefs</p>
<ul>
<li>a node's importance is determined by the importance of its neighbors thus this is also referred to as <strong>prestige</strong></li>
<li>degree centrality can be viewed as a <em>immediate</em> influence measure</li>
<li>eigenvector centrality can be viewed as a <em>long-term direct</em> influence measure</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Vertex degree centrality measure</h5>
<ul>
<li>For a random walk on a graph, the limiting probabilities for the nodes are proportional to degree. Hence, the proportion of times that a node is visited is a function of its degree.</li>
<li>This means that degree centrality is an appropriate measure for <strong>walk-based transfer processes such as the money exchange process</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Spanning vs. Induced Subgraphs (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPHkyRvLtIU&amp;app=desktop">video</a>)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A spanning subgraph is a subgraph obtained only by edge deletions. The vertex set of the subgraph is the entire vertex set of the original graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A subgraph obtained only by vertex deletion is called an induced subgraph. When deleting a vertex one must also delete all its incident edges.
The edge set of an induced subgraph is therefore a subset of the edge set of the original graph.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Conclusions</h5>
<p>It is important to match centrality measures to appropriate kinds of flow processes and the implicit flow characteristics they assume.</p>
