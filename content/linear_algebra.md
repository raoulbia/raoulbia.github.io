Summary: Some notes about Linear Algebra

On this page I keep some notes abbout GloVe and word2vec word embeddings. It's work in progress...


#### Matrix Factorization

* refers to decomposing matrices into their constituent parts
* makes it easier to calculate more complex matrix operations
* A common analogy for matrix decomposition is the factoring of numbers, such as the factoring of 10 into 2 x 5. 
  For this reason, matrix decomposition is also called matrix factorization. Like factoring real values, there are many 
  ways to decompose a matrix, hence there are a range of different matrix decomposition techniques.
* Matrix factorization methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) use low-rank approximations to decompose large 
  matrices capturing statistical information about a corpus.

* Common methods: QR, SVD, LU (see Resources below)
