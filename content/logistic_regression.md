On this page I keep some ontes on logistic regression.

#### Supervised Learning: Regression Techniques

Most supervised learning problems can be framed formally 
in terms of predicting a response, but prediction alone is often not
the main goal of the analysis. 

For example, many applications of
linear regression in the sciences are aimed primarily
at **understanding how the inputs of a system drive the outputs**.

An extremely complicated "black box" giving pure predictions would not be
very useful in and of itself.

*Gradient Descent*: iterative computation of adjusted feature weights

#### Linear vs. Logistic Regression: normalizing

* linear regression: must normalize features

* logistic regression: no need to normalize the data. 

see [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/29781/when-conducting-multiple-regression-when-should-you-center-your-predictor-varia) 
for a good discussion on the topic of data *centering* and *scaling* data features.
