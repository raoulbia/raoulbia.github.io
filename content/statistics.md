Summary: Statistics


#### Variance 
	
* is the mean of some measured variation
* i.e. the sum of squared differences (SS) divided by some quantity n.
* in the case of samples, SS is divided by n-1.
  
#### Standard Deviation

* is the square root of a given variance.
* this transformation expresses the value of the variance in the unit of whatever is being measured.
* For example Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a standard deviation. It is the sum of squared differences of 
the errors, expressed in the unit of the error being measured.
* When you see "root" something (e.g. RMSE) or "standard" something (Standard Error) it 
refers to a standard deviation which itself is a Variance transformed by taking the square root thereof.
