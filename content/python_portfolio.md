Summary: Python Portfolio
Status: draft

This portfolio has been created as part of my submission for an exemption to module **STAT40800 Data Prog with Python**.

In this portfolio is endeavour to showcase my Python skills in light of the material covered in the module. Skills are showcased using Jupyter notebooks. The links below point to notebooks stored as gists on my personal github account. The current page is hosted on my personal website that I use mainly to store code snippets that I frequently use.

#### Week 2: Data structures and control flow

* Knowledge of Python data structures e.g. lists and dictionaries are demonstrated in the notebooks below.

* Knowledge of control flow is showcased the [API notebook](https://gist.github.com/raoulbia/92990a454b8e719937fbf2b883009b54) (week 12 below) where exception handling has been implemented to deal with invalid submission strings.

#### Week 3: Modules, packages and iPython

* Knowledge of iPython is demsonstrated by the notebooks showcased in this portfolio

* Knowledge of Python modules and  packages is demonstrated by the **pypi package** I wrote and published: [shizen-gengo](https://pypi.org/project/shizen-gengo/0.1.2/). *Shizen gengo* is japanese for *natural language*. It is a small Python library that I wrote in order to easily perform common NLP tasks. The package can be installed with `pip install shizen-gengo==0.1.4`. The `shizen gengo` package and module [documentation can be found here](https://shizen-gengo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
